# Lumen Tutorial

This is a sample project for a tutorial session that I give. Feel free to have a look around but note that there are some blanks you need to fill.

## Coming from Laravel

If you're coming from Laravel, here are some differences you'll notice:

- In order to use a `.env` file to load env vars, you will need to uncomment the `Dotenv::load()` method in `bootstrap/app.php`.
- `php artisan` has a limited command set, and you'll need to generate your own key as there's no key:generate.
- Enable Eloquent by uncommenting `$app->withEloquent()` in `bootstrap/app.php`.
- The router used is different from that of Laravel.

## Getting Started

If you want to install Lumen from scratch and follow along, follow the instructions here: http://lumen.laravel.com/docs/installation

When you're ready to create a new project, issue the following command `lumen new lumen-api`

If you're using Homestead, this should be no different for you than a Laravel app.

If you're developing locally, you should know that the `artisan` command is missing the `serve` command. I recommend that you use PHP's built in web server: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public/`
